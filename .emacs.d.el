;; The usual definition for this variable relies on the hostname
;; "host.does.not.exist" not getting found via DNS.
;; Unfortunately, on some networks (those that are stupid), any host that does
;; not exist gets given a known IP that doesn't respond.
;; Hence the command tramp uses to decide the defaults of this option hangs,
;; causing emacs to hang on startup.
;; Here we give tramp a default value so the initialisation code is not run
;; if 'nslookup' returns an IP for "host.does.not.exist".
;; Otherwise we are on a network set up so that the check will not hang, and the
;; initialisation code may as well be run.
;; This is a problem somewhere before tramp 2.2.13 and after tramp <insert
;; version from solaris>.
;; Infortunately, we can't check for `tramp-version' before loading tramp, so we
;; check for the `emacs-version' that ship by default with these versions.
;; I know that 25.2 is fine, I'll assume for now that those older than this are
;; fine too.
